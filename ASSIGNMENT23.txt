1. **Media Queries**: Media queries in CSS allow you to apply different styles based on various characteristics of the user's device or viewport, such as screen size, resolution, orientation, and more. They enable you to create responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Use cases include adjusting layout, font sizes, and hiding or showing elements based on the device's capabilities.

2. **min-width vs. max-width**:
   - **min-width**: Targets devices with a minimum width equal to or greater than the specified value. It's commonly used to apply styles to devices with a certain minimum screen size, ensuring proper layout and readability on larger screens.
   - **max-width**: Targets devices with a maximum width equal to or less than the specified value. It's often used to apply styles to smaller devices or prevent styles from being applied on screens larger than a certain size, maintaining readability and preventing layout issues.

3. **Float and Clear**:
   - **Float**: The `float` property in CSS is used to push an element to one side of its container, allowing content to flow around it. It's commonly used for creating layouts where elements can wrap around each other, such as floating images within text or creating multi-column layouts.
     ```css
     img {
         float: left;
         /* or float: right; */
     }
     ```
   - **Clear**: The `clear` property in CSS is used to control the behavior of elements that are adjacent to floated elements. It specifies whether an element should be moved below any preceding floated elements. This property is often used to prevent unwanted wrapping or overlapping of elements.
     ```css
     .clearfix {
         clear: both;
     }
     ```
     In this example, the `.clearfix` class is commonly applied to a container element to ensure it clears any floated elements within it, preventing layout issues.
